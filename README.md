# Oil reports forecast (Aksyutkin Andrey)
Forecasting operating income by other companies' features. Main info:
* this project is made under Kristina Zheltova supervision as a part of personnel project for CMF (Center of Mathematical Finance)
* This task was made using LIGHTAUTOML library, suited for data forecasting
* All needed data and graphs are included in the code.

Post Scriptum (future work): time feature could "leak" because this model made train-test split not considering time factor. It may cause improper training.
